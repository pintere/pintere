								<p><b>What is narrative interviewing?</p></b>
								<p>One’s biographical experience (as social construct) referring to the historical events around him/her (Rosenthal, 1993). What we must not forget with this method is that people talk about the past from the perspective of today’s reality (Vajda, 2010). This technique emphasizes the life story as it is narrated by the interviewee. The basic information here is not just the given data (the content), but the narrative structure and linguistic characteristics. This is why it is truly important not to interrupt the narrator with any questions (without questioning the truthfulness of the narration). We can examine the difference between the narrated life and the experienced life history (Vajda, 2007). </p>
									<p><i>“…what we are in fact attempting is a reconstrction of both the narrator's biographical overall construction and the biographically relevant experiences. The relationship between the overall construct and the relevant experiences must be conceived of as reciprocal: the construct determines the relevancy of an experience and the cumulative relevant experiences form the construct.” (Rosenthal, 1993:62) </i> </p>
								<p>The method consists three main phases. First, the interviewer going to examine the interviewee’s whole life story from the beginning to the present, so during the main narrative it is forbidden to limit the conversation with any portioning or questioning. Only in the second part of the interview is allowed to ask, but only questions within the narrative, questions what are already mentioned during the interview. And the third part allows other questions according to the topic of the research. This third part was more emphatic during the interviews (questions what the person has not mentioned), but the main narrative started by the interviewees. </p>
								<p><b>Second World War and the Shoa research project</p></b>
								<p>During my university years I participated in a narrative interview (lifeway interview) research project about the Second World War and the Shoa. I learned narrative interviewing (the method and the analysis) the for several semesters before it so I gained an adequate experience of this area. We made interviews with Second Worlds War survivors to compare same events from different perspectives and to understand what internal psychic and external social processes shape the narrative </p>
								<p><b>1956 Hungarian Refugees in Belgium</p></b>
								<p>Then I could use this knowledge during my Erasmus in Belgium, where one of my research was the 1956 Hungarian refugees in Belgium (they fled away from the communist Hungary after the revolution). Although I didn't manage to make interviews by myself, I used a secondary hermeneutical analysis on existing narratives. If you are interested in this topic, I wrote a <a href="https://emese-pinter.medium.com/the-1956-hungarian-refugees-in-belgium-80742113a505" target="_blank">summary</a> for this research on Medium.</p>

								<p>I am pretty sure, nowadays I don't need to introduce design thinking, so mostly I would like to describe how I got close to it and what did I do to deepen my knowledge in this creative problem solving research method</p>
								<p>First of all I was in the right place at the right time. During my master program one of my teachers involved a SD company in the academic education. This semester showed us how our sociological knowledge is useful (e.g. participant observation, guided interviews) in the market. We can deeply understand users and actually make a difference on products or ideas. 
										<p>In our semester project we focused on problems/pains that univeristy students have at ELTE. First we found out (using participant observation) there is a lack of community spaces and the existing ones are the poorly equipped. Then we started to talk with students to understand why are these problems for them and what do they do to avoid these problems. Then my favourite part came, the brainstorming about the solutions and the narrowing down the best solutions and producing a prototype. Then we tested our prototype and in the end we sent a recommendation to the university on how to make its buildings student/user-friendly.</p>
										<p>This experience amazed me so much, I started to follow several UX researchers and SD enterprises.</p> 

										<p>Since then I participated in two Service Design Conferences (SD Day) and a Grow with Google Programme in Service Design - where I recieved a Creative Skills of Innovation Certiicate and also did a whole research.</p>

								<p><b>I have been using Social Listening to understand users and topics for several years in different issues.</p></b>
								<p> With Social Listening one can find out opinions of users without intervening or asking, so we can get a more honest and open answer to our research questions. Here I would like to add that I consider netnography (I recommend in this topic any books of Robert Kozinets, especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Netnography-Redefined-Robert-Kozinets/dp/1446285758">"Netnography: Redefined"(2015)</a>) as a similar research method - this is what I was using in my Bachelor thesis, wehere I wanted to map the relationship systems within a Facebook group. </p>
								<p> Social Listening would be my first choice if I need to understand a topic (a brand reputation, user pains, even customer journeys) deeply. Because people love to complain! Or to express their views on a product or service... I will now briefly present some topics and methods that can be well observed and used based on online conversations and mentions.</p>
									<p> In my Master thesis I presented with a qualitative analysis of over 1200 mentions, how the expression of Roma identity appears in online conversations (posts, comments, etc.) focusing on how Roma groups try to protect their personal and group identities from the negative attitudes of the majority society. The defense develops along the phenomenon of inward and outward deflection (Allport, 1999) and I also explain and interpret these in some elements of the theory of system justification (Jost, 1994).
									<p><b>Understanding the customer’s journey in selecting and implementing a new Internet subscription:</b> It is possible to build a customer journey from social or any online data using Social Listening. The topics/problems/pains that arise in the online conversations outline a customer journey's steps - with the touchpoints of the company and the user and with an emotional attachment. It can also help to improve a company's complaint handling methods (to understand what types of people use which forms of complaint or what is behind these complaints).</p>
									<p><b>What do people think about McDonald's food?</b> We can create a mindmap from the topics related to our research question, that helps to see (and understand) the whole picture together </p>
									<p><Based on what people choose shoes now and later?</b> With this method - using it frequently as a monitoring - we can also predict user behaviours and needs. </p>
								
								<p> My aim with this short introduction of my works (I can tell more detailed descriptions of my projects in person or via email) was to show how easily Social Listening can be used for scientific purposes and also in <b>marketing and user experience research.</b></p>

										<h2>Social data persona</h2>
										<p>a unique research method to understand users</p>
									</div>
									<!-- <div class="meta">
										 <p>2018</p> -->
										<!-- <a href="#" class="author"><span class="name">Jane Doe</span><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
									
								</header>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/persona.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this section I am introducing the main cornerstones of a social data persona analysis (based on a unique social data database)- what I do on a regular work day</p>
								<p><b>Describing a random project</b></p>
									<p>We wanted to describe and get a deeper understanding of the Hungarian youth (18-30 years) on Facebook - interested in green issues in order to support and optimize marketing campaigns / social media campaigns that effectively target the youth. </p>
								<p><b>How do we find the target group?</b></p>
								<p>We identify the 18-30 year-old Hungarian youth on Facebook based on an age estimation and big data look-alike modelling of social media activities. From this group we selected those whose social media activity showed some relevant “green interest”.</p>
									<p><b>What is <i>“green interest”?</i></p></b>
									<p>The database of about 100,000 Facebook pages contains 112 interest-based categories. The Facebook pages are being constantly categorized by our analysts based on what content the page shares. Pages that communicate green topics (sustainability, recycling, environmental protection ect.) are thus added to the green segment. Those Facebook users who have been active on these green pages were given a “green interest” tag.</p>
								<p><b>Interest based personas</p></b>
								<p>We are creating interest-based segments in the target group using an algorithmic-mathematical clustering procedure. We check all these clusters’ interests based on their social footprint and their connection to our 112 interest-based categories. In this project we have chosen two segments for further and deepen persona analysis: the most and least committed green interest clusters.</p>
								<p><b>THE GOALS OF THE ANALYSIS:</b></p>
								<p>1. To find out what characterizes the lifestyle and interest of the personas<br>
									2. To see what green and environmental topics do the personas have an affinity for and what kind of green attitude characterizes them<br>
									3. To reveal what characterizes the green topics related content preferences of the personas</p>
								<p><b>Communication insights - The content consumptions of the users</p></b>
								<p> This additional step gives us an even deeper understanding about the preferences of the personas - here the micro-insights of the “green interest” - by exploring and analysing the personas’ reactions on the contents shared by green topic related pages (those pages that have our green tag in our database). By doing so we can understand what niche green topics (e.g. alternative energy solutions, how to avoid food waste, personal environmental challenges etc.) get their attention and also we can reveal what messages, visual implementation, tone of voice, creative content can be used to address the personas effectively. <i> With this method we are able to show how the Client should build an effective communication campaign to reach its target group.</i> </p>
								<p><b>KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM A SOCIAL PERSONA PROJECT</p></b>
								<ul>
  									<li><p>Based on social media footprints we can understand our target group and customer segments on a deeper level: we can get a better insight on their motivations, needs and interests</li>
  									<li>Users tell us how (and what) we should communicate with them with their reactions on the web</li>
  									<li>This kind of analysis can always be complemented by other of our methods - if someone still prefers traditional research methods, we can enrich (and validate) these findings with surveys, interviews or focus groups</li></p>
