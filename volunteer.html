								<p><b>Since I was in high school, I have always done some volunteer jobs:</p></b>
								<p><b>SZIGET FESTIVAL</p></b>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/sziget.jpg" alt=""/></a>
								<p>I was working on the Sziget Festival for 7 years as an artist attendant (we called it “babysitter” because sometimes it was "babysitting"... artists can just disappear or get wander and forget the show): I was helping street theatre performers from all over the world to make their shows as smooth as possible. It needed my organisational and problem-solving skills when e.g. an Australian theatrical group needed a pair of sausages 5 minutes before their show or when a German company’s 100-year-old bicycle broke and I managed to replace it during the day (searching in all of the bike service stores in the city).</p>
								
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/mentoring.png" alt=""/></a>
								<p><b>Educational mentoring</p></b>
								<p> Nowadays I am a mentor for a sociology BA student. He has some learning difficulties, we have been studying and writing homework together. I have been there for him to consult papers for uni, to discuss his thesis or to prepare for admission to the master's program. </p>
								<p><b>Mentoring refugees</p></b>
								<p>In 2020, during the quarantine all of a sudden, I had a lot of free time, so I decided to find some other opportunity to spend it more helpful. <a href="http://www.artemisszio.hu/">Artemisszió Foundation</a> organized a course to train mentors to help immigrants and refugees in their daily lives, provide useful information and promote their social integration. So I joined them on a weekend in November and since then I am mentoring an Afghan mother (and her family) who lives here for a year. We meet regularly and I try to help them learning Hungarian and socializing in the Budapest life. Besides the language difficulties (their Hungarian is rudimentary and they don’t speak other than farsi) I can talk mostly with the kids who soak up the language like a sponge. With this program I also became a member of MIRA Intercultural Community, that organizes meetups and other community bulding events and courses. </p>
								<p><b>Budapest100</p></b>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/budapest100.jpg" alt=""/></a>
								<p><a href="http://budapest100.hu/en/">Budapest100</a> is a civil urban weekend-festival, where (about) 100-year-old houses all around Budapest open to everyone. "Budapest100 is a spring weekend celebration of the people and buildings around us." I have been participating as a visitor in this event for several years. I always waited with great excitement to see open houses and learn about the microhistory of the people living there. This year I joined them as an organizer volunteer: I asked residents is they want their house to participate i the festival and started to organize events. Even the house where I live is celebrating this year, so I cannot be more excited.</p>
