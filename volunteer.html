								<p><b>Since I was in high school, I have always done some volunteer jobs:</p></b>
								<p>I was working on the Sziget Festival for 7 years as an artist attendant (we called it “babysitter” :)): I was helping street theatre performers from all over the world to make their shows as smooth as possible. It needed my organisational and problem-solving skills when e.g. an Australian theatrical group needed a pair of sausages 5 minutes before their show or when a German company’s 100-year-old bicycle broke and I managed to replace it during the day (searching in all of the bike service stores in the city).</p>
								<p>Nowadays I am a mentor for a sociology BA student. He has some learning difficulties, so we studied and wrote homework together, I was there for him to consult papers for uni and discuss about his thesis. </p>
								<p>In 2020, during the quarantine all of a sudden, I had a lot of free time, so I decided to find some other opportunity to spend it more helpful. Artemisszió Foundation organized a course to train mentors to help immigrants and refugees in their daily lives, provide useful information and promoting social integration. So I joined them on a weekend in November and since then I am mentoring an Afghan mother (and her family) who lives here for a year. We meet regularly and I try to help them learning Hungarian and socializing in the Budapest life. Besides the language difficulties (their Hungarian is rudimentary and they don’t speak other than farsi) I can talk mostly to the kids who soak up the language like a sponge but since there is no school because of the Covid, their learning process lags. With this program I also became a member of MIRA Intercultural Community </p>
